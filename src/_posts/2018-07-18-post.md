#### Background
The evaluation of the societal value of interventions in health are informed by health economics but the most commonly used computational tools, often packages interacting with Excel, are limited in their ability to analyse increasingly large and complex data sets (e.g. in precision medicine or using "Big Data") in short time-frames (e.g. for emergency preparedness and response), and especially in the context of infectious disease modelling and associated probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

#### Aims
Our goal is to develop novel, user-friendly analysis tools for widespread adoption to enable better-informed, rapid decision making by health economists, practitioners and others using widely available software.

#### Format
An initial day workshop will be held at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) to scope and plan addressing current gaps, limitations and opportunities in the software commonly used for health economics methodologies, and discuss and map the requirements for conducting economic evaluations using the statistical software language R.
Workshop attendees will be invited from a range of areas to bring differing health economics problems and experience. 

#### Outcomes
The workshop will identify and clarify:

*	What is the demand for these tools and by whom? 
*	What are the issues with current software? 
*	What can and should the new tools do better?

The workshop will kick start prototypes of functions, data and packages to be released publicly (e.g. [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), as well as training courses in using the new tools and papers.

#### Preliminary program

9:00-9:30 Arrival w/ *Coffee*

9:30-9.45 Welcome [[Nathan Green, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nathan.green)]

9:45-10.15 *Why are we here and what do we hope to achieve?*

10:15-xxxx *Current tools for health economics*

General overview and particular strengths and weaknesses

10:30-11:00	TreeAge [tbc]

11:00-11:30	Microsoft Excel [tbc]

11:30-12:00 R [Nathan Green]

*Lunch*

1:00-xxxx *Identify health economic modelling needs & challenges*

* Present an example problem and solution in R [tbc]
* List of more examples problems to give idea of range of possible issues
* Determine pressing problems, issues or needs (current or future)
* In groups use these to discuss how to combine, narrow to core problems

2:00-xxxx *Clarify modelling needs*

In groups, answer the following questions and report back:

* Why do these need to be addressed? What will happen if they aren’t?
* How wide spread is the issue? How long has it been a problem and what the impact?
* What evidence is there of this?


3:00-xxxx	*Identify possible opportunities & solutions*

* Rank and prioritise problems
* With the help of an R expert, in each group think about ‘if we could…’, ‘if there was a way to…’

4:00-xxxx	*Next steps/Roadmap*

* Discuss and decide implementation
* Form working groups
* Task assignment
* Set timelines and milestones
* Communication channels e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
